       "1. **Sliding Window**: We maintain two pointers, `start` and `end`, which will represent the current window of characters being evaluated. `start` will denote the beginning of the window, and `end` will iterate through the string.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Dictionary for Characters**: We use a dictionary to map each character to its latest index (position) in the string. This allows us to quickly identify if a character has been seen before and, if so, its position.\n",

       "3. **Updating the Window**: As we iterate with the `end` pointer:\n",
       "   - If the character at `s[end]` is not in the dictionary (i.e., it hasn't been seen in the current window), we add it to the dictionary and expand the window by moving `end` to the right.\n",
       "   - If the character has been seen (it's already in the dictionary), we move the `start` pointer to the right of the last occurrence of this character to ensure all characters in the current window are unique.\n",

       "### Explanation of the Code:\n",
       "\n",
       "- We define a class `Solution` and a method `lengthOfLongestSubstring` that takes a string `s` as input.\n",
       "- We initialize a dictionary `char_index` to keep track of the last seen index of each character, a variable `max_length` to store the length of the longest substring found, and `start` to represent the beginning of the current substring window.\n",
       "- We loop through each character in the string using the `end` pointer. Inside the loop:\n",
       "  - If the character at `s[end]` has been seen before and falls within the current window (i.e., its last index is greater than or equal to `start`), we update `start` to the index immediately after the last occurrence of that character.\n",
       "  - Regardless of whether the character was seen or not, we update its last seen position in `char_index`.\n",
       "  - We compute the current length of the substring from `start` to `end` and update `max_length` if this new length is greater.\n",
       "- Finally, we return `max_length` as the output.\n",
       "\n",
       "This solution efficiently calculates the required length with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, making it suitable for the given constraints."
